description: Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow

Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Store:** This command always operates on this workspace's external OpenSpec
store. If `CE_OPENSPEC_STORE` is empty or unset, stop and tell the user to run
`ce start` first -- there is no store to work with. Every `openspec` command
below includes `--store "$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE"`.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name after `/archive` (e.g., `/archive add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `openspec list --store "$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE" --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --store "$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context -- these always resolve inside the external store, never inside the target repository or its Git worktree
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically `tasks.md`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Use `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON to check for delta specs. If none exist, proceed without sync prompt.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (resolved from the JSON, never a path relative to the current working directory or the target repository)
   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Show a combined summary before prompting

   **Prompt options:**
   - If changes needed: "Sync now (recommended)", "Archive without syncing"
   - If already synced: "Archive now", "Sync anyway", "Cancel"

   If user chooses sync, use Task tool (subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Use Skill tool to invoke openspec-sync-specs for change '<name>'. Delta spec analysis: <include the analyzed delta spec summary>"). Proceed to archive regardless of choice.

5. **Perform the archive**

   Create an `archive` directory under `planningHome.changesDir` if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive"
   ```

   Generate target name using current date: `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>`

   **Check if target already exists:**
   - If yes: Fail with error, suggest renaming existing archive or using different date
   - If no: Move `changeRoot` to the archive directory

   ```bash
   mv "<changeRoot>" "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>"
   ```

   Both `<changeRoot>` and `<planningHome.changesDir>` come from the `status --store "$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE" --json` output in step 2 -- always absolute paths inside the external store. Never substitute a repo-local or hand-constructed path.

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Spec sync status (synced / sync skipped / no delta specs)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** the archive path derived from `planningHome.changesDir`/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Output On Success (No Delta Specs)**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** the archive path derived from `planningHome.changesDir`/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** No delta specs

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Output On Success With Warnings**

```
## Archive Complete (with warnings)

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** the archive path derived from `planningHome.changesDir`/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** Sync skipped (user chose to skip)

**Warnings:**
- Archived with 2 incomplete artifacts
- Archived with 3 incomplete tasks
- Delta spec sync was skipped (user chose to skip)

Review the archive if this was not intentional.
```

**Output On Error (Archive Exists)**

```
## Archive Failed

**Change:** <change-name>
**Target:** the archive path derived from `planningHome.changesDir`/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/

Target archive directory already exists.

**Options:**
1. Rename the existing archive
2. Delete the existing archive if it's a duplicate
3. Wait until a different date to archive
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (openspec status --store "$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE" --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If sync is requested, use the Skill tool to invoke `openspec-sync-specs` (agent-driven)
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting
- Every `openspec` command must include `--store "$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE"`
- Never assume repo-local `openspec/` paths -- always use `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, and `artifactPaths` resolved from the CLI's JSON output, which point inside the external store
- Never modify product/application code during `/archive` -- this command only moves OpenSpec planning artifacts within the external store
- Never create `openspec/`, `.opencode/`, reports, or any other harness/config file or directory inside the target repository or its Git worktree -- archiving happens only inside the external store at `$CE_OPENSPEC_STORE`
- This command does not require a prior `/verify` or `/adversarial-review` report; it archives based on artifact/task completion only
